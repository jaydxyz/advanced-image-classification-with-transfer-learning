# Advanced Image Classification with Transfer Learning

This Python script demonstrates advanced image classification using transfer learning with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The script utilizes the InceptionV3 model, fine-tunes it on a custom dataset, and performs image classification.

## Features

1. Data Preparation:
   * Downloads a custom dataset of images for a specific classification task.
   * Preprocesses the images by resizing them to a consistent size and applying data augmentation techniques.

2. Transfer Learning:
   * Loads the pre-trained InceptionV3 model from the Keras library.
   * Freezes the weights of the pre-trained layers to retain the learned features.
   * Replaces the top layers of the model with custom dense layers suitable for the specific classification task.

3. Model Training:
   * Splits the dataset into training and validation sets.
   * Trains the modified model on the training data using data generators and callbacks.
   * Utilizes techniques such as learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and model checkpointing to optimize training.

4. Model Evaluation:
   * Evaluates the trained model on the validation set and calculates evaluation metrics.
   * Generates a classification report and confusion matrix for detailed performance insights.

5. Inference and Visualization:
   * Allows the user to provide new images for classification using the trained model.
   * Preprocesses the input images and passes them through the model to obtain predictions.
   * Visualizes the predicted class labels and corresponding probabilities for each input image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn matplotlib numpy

3. Prepare your custom dataset:
* Organize your dataset into subdirectories, where each subdirectory represents a class and contains the corresponding images.
* Update the `dataset_path` variable in the script with the path to your dataset directory.

4. Run the script: python advanced_image_classification.py

5. The script will perform the following steps:
* Preprocess the dataset and split it into training and validation sets.
* Load the pre-trained InceptionV3 model and fine-tune it on your dataset.
* Train the model using the training data and evaluate it on the validation set.
* Generate a classification report and confusion matrix.
* Allow you to provide new images for classification and visualize the predictions.

6. View the training history visualization, which includes accuracy and loss curves.

## Customization

- You can modify the `img_size` variable to adjust the input image size for the model.
- Experiment with different pre-trained CNN models by replacing `InceptionV3` with other models like `ResNet50` or `VGG16`.
- Adjust the hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate to suit your specific dataset and requirements.
- Customize the custom dense layers added on top of the pre-trained model to match your classification task.
